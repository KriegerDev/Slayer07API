# Slayer07
This is the slayer07 API repository, a lib made by me (for educational purposes).

## How it works?
It works by triggering commands in bulk, using multiple bots.

each bot is a different application (due to discord's rate-limit)

So this is a library to connect a controller (client) to several workers (servers/discord bots).

it transmits packets, which indicate commands

A customized setup for official use (clients and servers made by me), is available at: [link](https://github.com/KriegerDev/Discord-Slayer07)

If you want, you can create your own clients and servers, including the npm package.
